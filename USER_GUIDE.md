# Underwriting Screener - User Guide

This tool helps you quickly identify which insurance carriers are likely to write a specific risk based on their underwriting guidelines.

## How to Use It

### 1. Enter Risk Details
Fill out the **Risk Questionnaire** at the top of the page.
*   **Company Name & Size**: Helps identify small business vs. mid-market appetite.
*   **Industry & Business**: Be specific (e.g., "Fine Dining Restaurant" instead of just "Restaurant").
*   **Residential/Commercial**: Important for property risks.

### 2. Click "Screen Risk"
When you click the button, the bot performs a three-step analysis:
1.  **Search**: It scans thousands of pages of underwriting manuals for keywords related to your risk.
2.  **Analyze**: It uses AI to read the specific rules for each carrier (AmTrust, Travelers, CNA, etc.).
3.  **Classify**: It determines if each carrier is a **"Yes"**, **"Maybe"**, or **"No"**.

### 3. Review Results
You will see a summary table with:
*   **Carrier**: The name of the insurance company.
*   **Write Risk?**:
    *   `Yes`: strong match found in the guidelines.
    *   `Maybe`: might be eligible, but requires specific conditions (check the notes).
    *   `No`: explicitly excluded or outside appetite.
*   **Eligible Lines**: Shows which products they offer (e.g., BOP, WC, Umbrella).
*   **Restrictions / Notes**: Key details found in the manuals (e.g., "Must have < 3 claims in 3 years").

### 4. Ask Follow-up Questions
Below the results, you can chat with the AI.
*   **Smart Context**: The chat is **filtered**. It only "knows" about the carriers that were marked as **Yes** or **Maybe**.
*   **Example Questions**:
    *   *"What are the specific property age restrictions for Travelers?"*
    *   *"Does CNA require a central station alarm for this risk?"*
    *   *"Which of these carriers offers Cyber coverage?"*
